# scripts/ci-local.ps1 — Windows-local CI gate. Run this before tagging
# a release (git tag vX.Y.Z).
#
# GitHub Actions (ci.yml) now runs ONLY the macOS + Linux workspace test
# on push/PR — the platform coverage this Windows box cannot reproduce.
# The platform-independent gates (rustfmt, clippy, cargo deny) and the
# Windows test leg were moved here so they no longer burn Actions
# minutes on every commit. This script reproduces all of them locally.
#
# Behaviour: runs each gate in order, STOPS on the first failure, prints
# each step's exit code, and ends with a single PASS / FAIL line.
# Exit code: 0 when every gate passed, 1 otherwise.
#
# Usage:
#   pwsh -File scripts\ci-local.ps1
#   .\scripts\ci-local.ps1
