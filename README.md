## Relux (preview): one-command local control plane

Relux is the current product direction: a Prime-centered, plugin-first control
plane for agentic work that runs locally and serves its own dashboard. Boot it
with one command - no web bridge, no login:

```bash
cargo run -p relux-kernel -- serve
```

Then open the dashboard it prints:

```text
Relux dashboard: http://127.0.0.1:19891/dashboard
Relux API:       http://127.0.0.1:19891/v1/relux/state

Also available:
  GET /v1/relux/tasks/:id
  GET /v1/relux/runs/:id
  GET /v1/relux/runs/:id/events
  GET /v1/relux/audit?limit=N
```

### Optional LLM-backed Prime

By default, Prime is deterministic and rule-based. You can enable a natural,
LLM-backed chat path by configuring an OpenRouter API key. In this mode,
conversational replies (greetings, status, explanations) are shaped by the model
while actions (task creation, starting runs) stay grounded and deterministic in the
kernel.

1. Set `RELUX_OPENROUTER_API_KEY` to your OpenRouter key.
2. (Optional) Set `RELUX_OPENROUTER_MODEL` (default: `openai/gpt-4o-mini`).
3. (Optional) Set `RELUX_LLM_DISABLED=1` to force deterministic mode.

Keys are read from the environment and are never returned by the API or shown in the UI.

The dashboard opens on **Relux Home** (grounded control-plane state), where you
can chat with **Prime** (`POST /v1/relux/prime`), manage **work** (tasks and runs,
including detailed views and audit logs), and manage **crew** (agents) and install **plugins** - all backed by the local `/v1/relux` API, with no dependency on the legacy Relix bridge. It now also includes dedicated surfaces for managing pending approvals and granting permissions to agents.
The served bundle is the committed build under
`crates/relix-web-bridge/dashboard-dist` (rebuild with `npm run build` in
`apps/dashboard`). See [`docs/RELUX_MASTER_PLAN.md`](docs/RELUX_MASTER_PLAN.md)
section 22 for the full MVP boot guide.

---

Relix is a local mesh of peer processes for running AI agents safely on
your own machine. Every call between peers carries a signed identity
bundle, passes a policy check, and writes a hash-chained audit record
before any handler runs. Orchestration lives in small flow files
(`.sol` or `.sflow`) whose only mesh primitive is
`remote_call(peer, method, args)`. There is no central gateway, no
shared credential store, no opaque tool registry — the HTTP bridge
that fronts OpenAI-compatible clients is just another peer.

You boot it with one command (`relix boot`), point any OpenAI-style
client at `http://127.0.0.1:19791/v1`, and you have a multi-agent
runtime with persistent memory, a tool surface, a scheduler, and an
operator dashboard.

## Install

The default install gives you the latest **stable** release.

**Mac / Linux:**

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itsramananshul/Relix/main/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itsramananshul/Relix/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

Both installers do the same four things:

1. Drop `relix`, `relix-controller`, and `relix-web-bridge` into
   `~/.local/bin` (or `RELIX_INSTALL_DIR`) and put it on your
   `PATH`.
2. Drop the mesh boot scripts into `~/.local/scripts/`.
3. Run **`relix setup`** automatically — the guided wizard:
   pick provider, paste API key, tick channels, confirm.
4. Save your choices to `~/.relix/config.toml`.

### Install a beta (pre-release)

`RELIX_CHANNEL=beta` installs the newest pre-release instead of the
latest stable. Betas are GitHub pre-releases — never shown as "Latest"
— so the stable install above is unaffected.

**Mac / Linux:**

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itsramananshul/Relix/main/install.sh | RELIX_CHANNEL=beta bash
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
$env:RELIX_CHANNEL = 'beta'; irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itsramananshul/Relix/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

### Pin an exact version

`RELIX_VERSION` installs one specific tag — stable (`v0.4.2`) or beta
(`v0.4.3-beta.1`) — and always wins over the channel.

**Mac / Linux:**

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itsramananshul/Relix/main/install.sh | RELIX_VERSION=v0.4.3-beta.1 bash
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
$env:RELIX_VERSION = 'v0.4.3-beta.1'; irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itsramananshul/Relix/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

The same per-OS binaries are built for both channels (Linux x86_64/arm64,
macOS x86_64/arm64, Windows x86_64); the installer auto-detects yours.
See [docs/releasing.md](docs/releasing.md) for how channels are cut.

## Quick start

After install, the wizard has already saved your config. Boot
the mesh:

```sh
relix boot                      # reads ~/.relix/config.toml
                                # opens http://127.0.0.1:19791/dashboard

relix status                    # is it up? show the topology table.
relix stop                      # kill the controllers + bridge by name.

relix setup                     # re-run the wizard to change provider /
                                # rotate keys / add a channel.
```

No env vars to export. No `--provider` flag to repeat. No
`scripts/...` to run by hand. The wizard wrote your provider +
API key + channel selections to `~/.relix/config.toml`; `relix
boot` reads them every time.

Once the bridge is healthy you'll have:

| | |
|---|---|
| Dashboard       | http://127.0.0.1:19791/dashboard |
| OpenAI-compat   | `POST http://127.0.0.1:19791/v1/chat/completions` |
| WebSocket chat  | `ws://127.0.0.1:19791/ws/chat` |
| Health          | http://127.0.0.1:19791/health |
| Topology + caps | `GET /v1/topology`, `GET /v1/capabilities` |

Point any OpenAI-compatible client (the official Python SDK, Open
WebUI, LobeChat, Cursor, etc.) at the bridge:

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI(base_url="http://127.0.0.1:19791/v1", api_key="unused")
client.chat.completions.create(
    model="relix-openrouter",       # or relix-openai, relix-mock, ...
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "hello"}],
)
```

The bridge's API-key header is ignored — the real provider key
lives only on the AI node, sourced from `~/.relix/config.toml`.
See [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md) for the full
config reference, including the `[ai.memory_peer]` knobs for
automatic conversation-history injection and optional RAG over
the vector store.

|---------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `memory`      | 19711        | SQLite + FTS5 chat memory, vector embeddings, persistent agent memory       |
| `ai`          | 19712        | `ai.chat` / `ai.embed` — `mock` / `openai` / `anthropic` / `openrouter` / `xai` / `gemini` / `local` |

Every node is its own OS process with its own libp2p identity. Every
inbound call passes: **identity verify → policy admit → handler →
signed audit record**. No bypass switch.

## Highlights

- **Bring your own provider.** `ai.chat` routes to `mock`, `openai`,
  `openrouter`, `xai`, `anthropic`, `gemini`, or any
  OpenAI-compatible `local` endpoint (Ollama, vLLM). Provider keys
  live only on the AI node. See [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md).
- **Vector memory built in.** `memory.embed` + `memory.search` give
  you cosine top-K over per-subject embeddings; defaults to mock 8-dim
  vectors, switches to OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small` by changing the
  AI provider. [docs/memory.md](docs/memory.md).
- **Durable agents.** Every flow gets a `Task` row in the
  coordinator's SQLite ledger with attempts, events, lineage, todos,
  and pause/resume/cancel/replay primitives. [docs/coordination.md](docs/coordination.md).
- **Scheduled work.** `cron.create` accepts cron expressions, duration
  intervals, or one-shot timestamps. [docs/scheduler.md](docs/scheduler.md).
- **Channels.** Telegram, Discord, Slack, and Email channels route
  through the same SOL chat flow as the HTTP bridge and persist
  conversations in `memory`. [docs/channels/index.md](docs/channels/index.md).
- **Multi-agent planning.** The coordinator's planning pipeline
  (planner + critic) decomposes natural-language specs into delegated
  sub-tasks. Inspect via `relix planning plan --spec "..."`.
- **Knowledge-share.** Agents can share observations peer-to-peer with
  Ed25519-bound provenance. Source trust is configured per public key
  (`[knowledge_trust]`).
- **Training pipeline.** Interaction recording → PII anonymisation →
  quality scoring → OpenAI-format export. Controlled via `[training]`.
- **Confidence and reasoning.** Per-method rolling confidence scores
  feed the judge + belief-state engine (`[confidence]`,
  `relix confidence history`).
- **Metrics, observability, and alerting.** SQLite metrics store, cost
  tracking by model, OTLP export, configurable alert thresholds
  (`[metrics]`, `relix metrics`, `relix observe`).
- **Credentials vault.** Encrypted at-rest credential store; JIT
  injection into tool args via `{{secret:<name>}}` placeholders
  (`[credentials]`, `relix credentials`).
- **Approval gate.** Per-method approval tokens (Ed25519-signed, TTL
  30–86400 s). `RELIX_APPROVAL_SIGNING_KEY` env var required.
  Standing approvals and out-of-band delivery channels supported.
- **Mesh PII gate.** Inline regex scan of every inbound arg before
  handler dispatch; actions: `block`, `redact` (default), `log_only`.
  Writes a separate `pii_events.sqlite` chronicle (`[mesh_pii]`,
  `relix pii`).
- **Tenant isolation.** Per-tenant policy files + per-tenant SQLite
  audit mirror. Query via `node.audit.tenant_recent`.
- **Plugins.** Any language that can speak HTTP can ship a plugin —
  declared in `plugin.toml`, loaded as a subprocess by `plugin_host`,
  callable from SOL and `.sflow` like any built-in. Python (stdlib
  only) and Rust SDK examples ship. [docs/plugins.md](docs/plugins.md).
- **Three flow formats.** `.sol` is a Rust-flavoured imperative DSL;
  `.sflow` is a line-oriented step DSL with `try/catch`, loops, and
  `${var}` interpolation; `.yml`/`.yaml` is a YAML frontend that
  lowers to SOL. [docs/sol.md](docs/sol.md).
- **MCP support.** Register external MCP servers as proxied
  capabilities via `tool.mcp.*`.
- **Operator console.** The `/dashboard` single-page app ships
  twenty-two panels: Overview, Tasks, Scheduled Jobs, Chat,
  Memory, Approvals, Skills, Sessions, Reasoning, Credentials,
  Identity, Cost & Metrics, Observability, Policy Denials,
  Multi-Tenant, Planning, Workflows, Email, Plugins, MCP Servers,
  Configuration, and Logs. No extra config. Mesh topology, health,
  cost, pending approvals, and recent activity roll up into the
  Overview panel; the task ledger, cron jobs, policy denials, and
  MCP servers each have their own panel, backed by `/v1/tasks`,
  `/v1/cron/jobs`, `/v1/policy/denials`, and `/v1/mcp/servers`.
  The **Mandates** page turns a high-level goal into a Brief tree and
  guides it through governance: propose + approve a strategy, plan the
  team, inspect readiness, approve/reject pending clearances, then
  orchestrate (plan-only / create / create + assign, with a dry-run
  preview) and watch progress — over the existing `mandate.orchestrate`
  engine. Governance is surfaced, not bypassed.
  First sign-in creates a single admin (username + Argon2id password).
  **Forgot the local admin password?** Run
  `scripts/relix-dashboard-admin-reset.ps1` (Windows) or
  `scripts/relix-dashboard-admin-reset.sh` (macOS/Linux) — or
  `relix-web-bridge reset-admin` directly — then restart the bridge.
  It rewrites only the admin credential (`~/.relix/dashboard-admin.json`),
  prints a fresh password, and is **local-only**: there is no
  remote/unauthenticated reset.
- **Maintenance & storage.** Settings → *Maintenance & storage* (or
  `GET /v1/maintenance/summary`) shows run-workspace disk usage + run/log
  counts + warnings. Prune old run workspaces safely with a dry-run preview
  (`POST /v1/maintenance/prune`, dry-run by default — never touches the repo
  or a running run). Every prune is recorded in a durable audit
  (`GET /v1/maintenance/audit`, shown as *Cleanup history*). Optional
  scheduled cleanup (`RELIX_MAINTENANCE_AUTOPRUNE_*`, off + dry-run by
  default) automates it on a timer. Back up / restore local state with
  `scripts/relix-local-backup.ps1` / `.sh`. See `docs/operations.md`.

## Security model

- Each node runs as its own OS process with its own Ed25519 identity
  bundle, signed by an org root key.
- Every inbound call is verified against the bundle's signature and
  the org root before any handler logic runs.
- A per-node `PolicyEngine` evaluates `[admit]` groups + per-method
  `[[rules]]`. Default-deny; nothing runs without a matching allow.
- Every responder appends a signed, hash-chained record to its
  `audit.log` — `relix-flow-inspect` reads them offline.
- AI provider keys live **only** in the `ai` node's local config. The
  HTTP bridge never sees them.
- The tool node enforces a jailed filesystem root, an SSRF-guarded
  web client, an allowlisted shell, and PDF / chunk-size caps.

[docs/security.md](docs/security.md) and [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Vex

The amber-and-electric-blue spider-phoenix in the logo is Vex. It's
the Relix mascot — geometric web silk on the wings, eight angular
legs, a burning ember at the centre. The metaphor is web (mesh) +
phoenix (durable, restart-safe). It also doubles as a favicon.
