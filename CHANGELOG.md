## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Multi-agent orchestration (first slice): Prime as an orchestrator.** Prime can
  now decompose a multi-step goal into role-typed **briefs assigned to different
  agents** and run them in a **governed multi-agent batch**, instead of being a
  single local task runner (master plan section 10.4 Delegation Rules, section 15).
  Planning is a pure, deterministic brain
  (`relux_core::plan_orchestration`): it splits a goal into clauses, classifies
  each to a role (`research`/`implementation`/`testing`/`review`/`documentation`/
  `operations`/`general`), and grounds each role to a real agent on the roster (or
  falls back to Prime with an honest "hire a specialist" note). It is conservative
  — a goal that does not split into ≥2 briefs is not treated as multi-agent, so
  greetings and single tasks never storm. Creating an orchestration mints one brief
  (task) per step, assigns each to its agent, and records a durable
  `Orchestration` linking **goal → brief → agent → run** (persisted in the kernel
  snapshot/store, survives a refresh). Running is a separate governed batch: each
  pending brief runs through **its assigned agent's own adapter** (local Prime
  echoes; an **enabled** Claude/Codex CLI agent spawns the real CLI; a
  disabled/unconfigured runtime or missing permission is recorded as **blocked**,
  never faked), bounded by `max` (1..=25), running each brief at most once,
  recording per-agent outcomes + the next human action, and **stopping safely** (no
  loops, no runaway, never auto-runs downloaded plugin code). Surfaces:
  `relux-kernel prime orchestrate "<goal>"` / `prime orchestration list|show|run`;
  `POST /v1/relux/prime/orchestrate/preview`, `…/orchestrations` (create/list),
  `…/orchestrations/:id` (get), `…/orchestrations/:id/run`; a Prime-page
  **Orchestration** panel (goal → preview → create → run/continue with per-agent
  briefs and outcomes) and a Home summary card (pure logic in
  `apps/dashboard/src/orchestration.ts`, unit-covered). The background autonomy
  timer is unchanged — still deterministic, echo-only, never a paid CLI;
  orchestration is operator-triggered. **Proven against the real Claude CLI:** a
  two-agent orchestration where Prime (local echo) handled the research brief and a
  Claude-CLI `code-agent` handled the implementation brief — a real 44s Claude run
  with reported token usage and cost, fully traced goal → brief → agent → run.
  *Caveats:* briefs run sequentially (no parallelism), there is no inter-brief
  dependency ordering, planning does not auto-create agents, and no background timer
  drives orchestrations yet.
- **Relux local release v0.1.2 (Windows bundle).** The `relux-kernel` /
  `relux-core` crates move from `0.1.1` to `0.1.2` for the first build that closes
  the three honest post-v0.1.1 gaps. **First-run brain onboarding:** Home's
  first-run checklist now derives a **live "connect Prime to a brain" step** from
  the control plane (`/v1/relux/ai/status` + `/v1/relux/adapters`) — it detects
  whether the Claude/Codex CLI is on PATH, reports whether the selected brain is
  actually usable, and routes the operator to Health → *Prime Brain / AI Runtime*
  with the exact next step (pure derivation in `apps/dashboard/src/onboarding.ts`,
  unit-covered). **Honest plugin install UX for metadata-only wrappers:** a
  generated metadata-only GitHub/zip wrapper is badged **Needs configuration**
  (never "enabled"/"ready"); its honest next step is **add tool definitions** (a
  one-click *Set up* with a copy/download manifest template), the install flow
  shows a **result summary** (tools discovered vs wrapper generated vs adapter),
  and the Tools list shows **only runnable tools** by default
  (`apps/dashboard/src/plugins.ts`, unit-covered). **Adapter run depth:** a CLI
  adapter run is now observable and recoverable — Run Detail shows the adapter,
  status, phase, a real measured duration, a redacted **output excerpt**, a clear
  failure reason, and (when reported) cost/usage, all from the durable transcript;
  the Claude adapter requests a **structured JSON result envelope** parsed into an
  honest summary + metrics (`relux_core::parse_adapter_result`, an envelope
  `is_error` is a failure even on a clean exit), Codex/generic commands degrade
  honestly to plain text, and a **failed run is retryable** as a fresh run
  (`prime.retry_run` → `POST /v1/relux/runs/:id/retry`) with lineage recorded
  (`retried_from`). Proven against the **real Claude and Codex CLIs**. *Caveats:*
  runs are synchronous (the page polls/refreshes rather than tailing live events),
  Codex/generic output is plain text (no structured envelope), and retry is a
  fresh attempt — **not** a resume of a partial CLI run. This version line is the
  `relux-kernel` crate version (separate from the Relix workspace version below);
  build the bundle with `scripts\relux-package-local.ps1 -FullE2E`. See
  `docs/RELUX_MASTER_PLAN.md` → *Release history*.
- **Relux local release v0.1.1 (Windows bundle).** The `relux-kernel` /
  `relux-core` crates move from `0.1.0` to `0.1.1` for the first build that makes
  **Prime brain selection** a first-class dashboard surface. Health → *Prime
  Brain / AI Runtime* lets the operator choose who answers Prime's conversational
  turns — Local (deterministic), Claude CLI, Codex CLI, or OpenRouter — with a
  one-click *"Use Claude/Codex for Prime"* that enables the adapter and selects
  the brain together, plus live adapter status and the exact install/sign-in next
  step. No JSON editing or CLI flags are needed for normal Claude setup. The
  dev/test `echo` tool is no longer presented as a product path (internal smoke
  plumbing only), and the blank/legacy-route fix is retained. This version line is
  the `relux-kernel` crate version (separate from the Relix workspace version
  above); build the bundle with `scripts\relux-package-local.ps1 -FullE2E`. See
  `docs/RELUX_MASTER_PLAN.md` → *Release history*.
- **Release readiness CLI.** `relix release readiness` now prints the
  local first-release gate, current binary version, expected tag, git
  HEAD, clean/dirty state, and local/origin tag presence; it can run the
  full Windows-local release gate with `--require-clean --run-local-gate`
  without enabling GitHub Actions or spending model provider credits.

### Documentation

- Recorded the operator-console redesign that shipped in **v0.3.0**
  but was never logged here. The original single-page dashboard (task
  ledger plus topology and chronicle-retention widgets) was rebuilt
  into a multi-panel console; the current build carries twenty-two
  panels: Overview, Tasks, Scheduled Jobs, Chat, Memory, Approvals,
  Skills, Sessions, Reasoning, Credentials, Identity, Cost & Metrics,
  Observability, Policy Denials, Multi-Tenant, Planning, Workflows,
  Email, Plugins, MCP Servers, Configuration, and Logs. Source of
  truth: the `SECTIONS` array in
  `crates/relix-web-bridge/src/dashboard.html`.
- Corrected README and the dashboard docs to the real panel
  inventory and removed the false `#/...` hash-route claims; the
  console has no hash routing. Each panel is backed by a real route
  (for example `/v1/tasks`, `/v1/cron/jobs`, `/v1/policy/denials`,
  `/v1/mcp/servers`). There is no standalone Audit-log panel; audit
  data is reachable through the Credentials, MCP, and Multi-Tenant
  panels and the hash-chained `audit.log` files (read with
  `relix-flow-inspect`).
- Marked `ADVERSARIAL_AUDIT.md` (2026-05-29) as superseded. Its top
  findings were remediated across v0.3.0–v0.4.3-beta.1 (real approval
  channel dispatch, Argon2id credential KDF, fail-closed agent
  admission, intentional manual-only CI), so it overstates current
  risk and is retained for history only.

## [0.4.3-beta.1] - 2026-06-01

First build on the **beta** channel (GitHub pre-release; not "Latest").

### Added

- **Beta install channel.** `RELIX_CHANNEL=beta` (install.sh /
  install.ps1) installs the newest pre-release; `RELIX_VERSION` pins any
  exact tag. Per-OS one-liners documented in the README.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-06-01

Self-healing, long-lived node identities; documentation reconciliation;
manual-only CI; beta/stable release channels.

### Fixed

- **Identity bundles no longer lapse.** Locally-minted node/service
  identities now default to a **365-day** lifetime (was 24h), and the
  mesh-up scripts self-heal at boot via `relix identity ensure` —
  (re)minting any bundle that is missing, expired, signed by a stale org
  root, or within its renewal window. A fresh install always boots; a
  long-running mesh renews ahead of expiry. Expiry remains enforced.
- Stopped committing pre-minted `dev-keys/*.bundle` files (carried a
  wall-clock expiry + a local org root absent on fresh checkouts).

### Added

- **`relix identity ensure`** — self-healing/renewing mint used by boot
  and the mesh-up renewal loop. `BundleHeader::needs_renewal` /
  `seconds_until_expiry` renewal primitives in `relix-core`.
- **Beta + stable release channels** driven by tag shape: `vX.Y.Z` =
  stable (Latest), `vX.Y.Z-beta.N` = GitHub pre-release. See
  `docs/releasing.md`.

### Changed

- **CI is manual-only** (`workflow_dispatch`) — no pass/fail status on
  every commit; the CI badge was removed from the README.
- **Documentation reconciled with the 0.4 codebase** — 78 docs updated,
  8 new (planning, four-layer-memory, memory-security, reasoning-pipeline,
  credentials, approval-tokens, embedded, channels/email).
- Workspace version bumped to `0.4.2`.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-06-01

Release engineering fix for the `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` cross build.

### Fixed

- **`Cross.toml` arm64 OpenSSL**: added `pre-build` hook that installs
  `libssl-dev:arm64` inside the cross container, fixing the link
  failure for `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` release targets.

### Changed

- Workspace version bumped to `0.4.1`.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-31

Headline features shipped in the 0.4 series (on top of the 0.1 mesh
foundation). No wire-format or config-breaking changes from 0.3.

### Added

- **Multi-agent planning pipeline** (`[planning]`) — coordinator-side
  planner + critic that decomposes natural-language specs into
  delegated sub-tasks. Inspect via `relix planning plan`.
- **Knowledge-share** (`[knowledge]` + `[knowledge_trust]`) —
  peer-to-peer observation transfer with Ed25519-bound provenance.
  Source trust configured per public key; `allow_unbound_sources = false`
  is the fail-closed default.
- **Training pipeline** (`[training]`) — interaction recording to
  SQLite, optional PII anonymisation, quality scorer, OpenAI-format
  export via `relix training export`.
- **Confidence / reasoning engine** (`[confidence]`) — per-method
  rolling-window confidence scorer; feeds the judge + belief-state
  engine. Inspect via `relix confidence history`.
- **Metrics, observability, and alerting** (`[metrics]`,
  `[observability]`) — SQLite metrics store, cost-by-model tracking,
  OTLP export, configurable alert thresholds with fan-out targets.
  Live TUI via `relix observe`.
- **Credentials vault** (`[credentials]`) — AES-GCM encrypted at-rest
  credential store; JIT secret injection into tool args via
  `{{secret:<name>}}`. Managed via `relix credentials`.
- **Approval gate + Ed25519 approval tokens** (`[approval]`) —
  per-method approval requirements; `coord.approval.decide` mints
  Ed25519-signed tokens (TTL 30–86400 s, default 300 s). Standing
  approvals and out-of-band delivery channels supported.
  `RELIX_APPROVAL_SIGNING_KEY` env var required for token minting.
- **Mesh PII gate** (`[mesh_pii]`) — inline regex scan of every
  inbound `RequestEnvelope.args` before handler dispatch; actions
  `block`, `redact` (default), `log_only`. Writes `pii_events.sqlite`
  chronicle; queryable via `relix pii stats/events`.
- **Plugin sandbox** — `plugin_host` node type; each capability
  registered under bare name + `plugin_host.<method>` alias.
- **Tenant isolation** — per-tenant policy files (`[policy] dir`);
  per-tenant SQLite audit mirror (`[audit] partition_by_tenant`);
  queryable via `node.audit.tenant_list` / `node.audit.tenant_recent`.
- **Budget enforcer** (`[budget]`) — per-caller spend caps; dormant
  when no caps are configured.
- **`email` controller node type** — SMTP outbound + IMAP inbound
  channel bridge; manageable via `relix email`.
- **YAML flow format** — `.yml`/`.yaml` flows lowered to SOL before
  VM execution; dispatched by `FlowRunner` alongside `.sol` and
  `.sflow`.
- **Streaming `remote_call_stream`** — SOL VM opcode + flow-runner
  dispatcher over `/relix/rpc/stream/1` substreams with chunk
  observer and cancel signal.
- **Per-tenant audit partition** (GAP 23C) — `AuditPartitionStore`
  SQLite mirror with tenant sanitisation; two new built-in caps
  `node.audit.tenant_list` and `node.audit.tenant_recent`.
- **Transactional gateway** (`[execution]`) — three-tier action
  classification (auto-compensated / human-rollback / blocked),
  persistent `TransactionStore`, `EvidenceStore` with PII redaction
  and state-diff capture. CLI surface: `relix execution`.

### Changed

- **`validate_controller_node_type` (SEC §13)** — unknown `node_type`
  values are now hard errors at boot. Previously they produced a
  silent no-op process that appeared healthy.
- **Node-type set expanded** — `SUPPORTED_CONTROLLER_NODE_TYPES` now
  includes `email` alongside `memory`, `ai`, `coordinator`,
  `telegram`, `discord`, `slack`, `plugin_host`, `tool`.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-05-25

Boot-loop polish on top of the v0.1.4 install fixes. No
mesh-protocol or wire-format changes — same binaries, same flow
templates, same configs.

### Fixed

- **`relix boot` now blocks the terminal until the mesh stops**
  instead of returning the prompt as soon as the bridge becomes
  healthy. Previously the boot script's cleanup output raced the
  shell prompt — operators saw their prompt back before the
  controllers had finished tearing down on `relix stop` from
  another terminal. The boot command now waits on the script's
  exit and forwards Ctrl-C through to it.
- **PowerShell mesh script: replaced `TreatControlCAsInput` loop
  with a 500ms poll loop** that works correctly when the script is
  launched via `Command::spawn` from `relix boot`. The old loop
  silently no-op'd in non-interactive spawned contexts, leaving
  the script running forever after a clean `relix stop`.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-05-24

Zero-configuration install. After this release the
`curl | bash` / `irm | iex` one-liner ends with a running mesh
and an open dashboard — no env vars to export, no scripts to
clone, no flags to remember.

### Added

- **`relix setup`** — guided interactive wizard. Five pages
  (welcome → provider picker → hidden API-key input → channel
  multi-select with per-channel secret follow-ups → confirm and
  save). Runs automatically at the end of `install.sh` /
  `install.ps1`; can be re-run any time to change provider,
  rotate keys, or add a channel. crossterm-driven raw terminal
  input; Ctrl-C exits 130 with the terminal restored.
- **`~/.relix/config.toml`** — persistent operator config. Holds
  `[provider]` (name + api_key), `[channels]` (per-channel
  toggle + token + channel-id), and `[mesh]` (data_dir,
  bridge_port). Written `chmod 600` on POSIX via tmp-write +
  rename so an interrupted save can't half-write the file.
  Every field has a serde default so partial configs deserialise.
- **Config-driven `relix boot`** — reads
  `~/.relix/config.toml` on startup and translates it into the
  env vars the mesh-up script consumes. The right
  `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_KEY` / etc. is set
  automatically from `provider.api_key`; channel toggles +
  tokens are wired through. Explicit `--with-*` flags still
  stack on top.
- **`memory.recent_for_session` auto-injection** — `[ai.memory_peer]
  max_history_turns = N`. With this set, the AI node fetches
  recent turns itself and merges them with any caller-supplied
  history, so flow templates no longer need to chain
  `memory.recent_for_session` → `ai.chat` manually. Silent skip
  on memory peer failure.
- **RAG retrieval** — `[ai.memory_peer] rag_enabled = true` +
  `rag_top_k` + `rag_min_score`. When set, the AI node embeds
  the user prompt locally and queries `memory.search` across
  both agent and user vector stores, formatting the top-K hits
  as a "Relevant context from memory" block prepended to the
  system prompt. `memory.search` wire grew an optional
  `embedding=<base64-LE-f32>` 5th field so the precomputed
  vector skips the responder's own embed RPC. Silent skip on
  empty results, embedding failure, or peer unreachable.
- **`GET /ws/chat`** — WebSocket streaming endpoint. JSON
  request `{session_id, message, model?}` followed by a stream
  of `{type: "chunk", text: "..."}` frames terminated by
  `{type: "done", session_id, text}`. Bearer auth on the
  upgrade (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`; loopback alpha
  accepts any non-empty token). `ChatProvider` gained
  `generate_reply_stream`; the mock provider streams
  word-by-word with a 20ms gap, and the OpenAI-compatible
  provider parses real `delta.content` deltas from the upstream
  SSE response.
- **`relix boot` / `relix stop` / `relix status`** — top-level
  CLI subcommands implemented in `crates/relix-cli/src/mesh.rs`.
  Cross-platform shim around the mesh-up scripts; `stop` kills
  by name (`taskkill /F /IM` on Windows, `pkill -x`
  elsewhere); `status` polls `/health` + `/v1/topology` and
  prints a peer-by-peer table.
- **`relix setup` bundled with install** — install scripts now
  call `relix setup` as their last step. They also fetch the
  mesh-up + mesh-down scripts from the main branch and drop
  them in `~/.local/scripts/` so `relix boot` has them after a
  binary-only install. `scripts/relix-mesh-down.ps1` ships as
  the Windows counterpart to `relix-mesh-down.sh`.
- **All three binaries in each release archive** — every
  per-target archive now contains `relix` (= `relix-cli`),
  `relix-controller`, and `relix-web-bridge` so `relix boot`
  can spawn its siblings from the same directory.

### Changed

- **Default data dir** is now `~/.relix/data/<run>/` instead of
  the repo-relative `dev-data/<run>/`. Repo-checkout
  development still uses `dev-data/` automatically. Docs and
  README updated.
- **README + getting-started** rewritten around the wizard
  flow. Env-var exports for API keys are no longer the
  recommended path — config-file primary, env-var fallback.
- **CI workflow** runs on manual `workflow_dispatch` only;
  contributors run the same gates locally
  (`cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets
  -- -D warnings`, `cargo test --workspace`). Re-enable push
  triggers when CI gates are needed on every commit.

### Fixed

- `install.ps1` no longer crashes with "the property 'Count'
  cannot be found on this object" under PowerShell strict mode
  when the release zip contains a single `relix.exe`.
- `parse_literal_ip` in `tool.web_fetch`'s SSRF guard now
  strips brackets from IPv6 hosts (`url::Url::host_str()`
  returns IPv6 with brackets); previously `[::1]` and
  `[fe80::1]` fell through to DNS and were rejected as
  `DnsFailed` on Linux/macOS instead of `IpForbidden`.
- `.sflow` parser preserves the user's dotted target verbatim
  as `wire_method`, and plugin capabilities are double-
  registered (bare name + `plugin_host.<method>` alias) so the
  natural `step x: plugin_host.hello.greet "..."` form admits
  against the bridge handler.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-23

First public alpha. Everything below is real and ships.

### Mesh and dispatch

- Mesh of OS-process peers connected via libp2p (`/relix/rpc/1`
  over TCP + Noise XK + Yamux). CBOR envelopes carry caller's
  signed `IdentityBundle`, method, args, deadline.
- Six controller node types (`memory`, `ai`, `tool`, `coordinator`,
  `router`, `plugin_host`) plus the `relix-web-bridge` HTTP front.
  Each node is its own OS process with its own dispatch bridge.
- Admission pipeline on every responder: decode → identity verify
  → deadline check → `PolicyEngine` evaluate → handler dispatch
  → audit append. The audit log is signed and hash-chained
  (`relix-core/src/eventlog.rs`).
- Five built-in capabilities on every node: `node.health`,
  `node.manifest`, `node.dispatch.stats`, `node.policy.simulate`,
  `node.policy.recent_denials`.

### AI and memory

- `ai.chat` and `ai.embed` on the `ai` node, with provider routing
  for `mock`, `openai`, `openrouter`, `xai`, `anthropic`, `gemini`,
  and a `local` Ollama-compatible base URL. Provider keys live only
  in the AI node's local config.
- `memory.write_turn`, `memory.recent_for_session`,
  `memory.search_turns` (FTS5) on the `memory` node — SQLite-backed
  per-session conversation history.
- Vector memory: `memory.embed`, `memory.search` (cosine,
  top-K up to 20), `memory.embed_all`. Default 8-dim mock vectors;
  switch the AI node to OpenAI-compatible to get real
  `text-embedding-3-small`. See `docs/vector-memory.md`.
- Persistent agent memory: `memory.agent_read`, `memory.agent_write`,
  `memory.agent_curate`, `memory.curator_status`.

### Tools

- File system: `tool.read_file`, `tool.write_file`, `tool.append_file`,
  `tool.patch`, `tool.patch_preview`, `tool.fuzzy_replace`,
  `tool.search_files`, `tool.list_dir`, `tool.fs.tree`,
  `tool.fs.stat`, `tool.binary_sniff`, `tool.fs.audit_recent` —
  all scoped to operator-configured jail roots.
- Web: `tool.web_fetch`, `tool.web_get`, `tool.web_search`,
  `tool.web_extract`, `tool.web.post`, `tool.web.robots_check`,
  `tool.web.blocklist_summary` — SSRF-guarded, blocklist-aware.
- Terminal: `tool.terminal.run` and friends — allowlisted commands
  only, via `portable-pty`. Sessions are pausable, resumable, and
  fully audited.
- Browser automation: `tool.browser.*` — headless Chrome / WebDriver
  with per-session lifecycle.
- MCP integration: `tool.mcp.list_servers`, `tool.mcp.list_tools`,
  `tool.mcp.invoke` — registers external MCP servers as proxied
  capabilities.
- PDF and text: `tool.pdf`, `tool.text.chunk`.

### Coordinator

- Durable task ledger: `task.create`, `task.update`, `task.event`,
  `task.list`, `task.get`, `task.attempt`, `task.todo`,
  `task.metadata`, `task.link_parent`, `task.cancel`, `task.retry`,
  `task.recover`, `task.replay`, `task.lineage`, plus pause/resume/
  freeze/unfreeze and note/investigation.
- Multi-agent coordination: `delegate.spawn`, `delegate.result`,
  `delegate.cancel`, `delegate.list` with a configurable depth cap.
- Inter-task messaging: `msg.send`, `msg.inbox`, `msg.read`,
  `msg.thread`, `msg.delete` with TTL.
- Cron / scheduler: `cron.create`, `cron.list`, `cron.get`,
  `cron.update`, `cron.delete`, `cron.trigger` — supports cron
  expressions, duration intervals, and one-shot.

### Channels

- Telegram, Discord, and Slack channel controllers. Each polls the
  bot platform's API, forwards messages to AI through the same SOL
  flow used by the HTTP bridge, and persists conversation history
  in `memory`. Opt-in per channel via env vars.

### Plugins

- `plugin_host` node type with `relix-plugin-v1` HTTP/JSON protocol
  for subprocess plugins. SDK crate (`relix-plugin-sdk`) for Rust
  authors; the protocol is the contract, so plugins in any language
  that can speak HTTP are supported (Python example ships).
- Management capabilities: `plugin.list`, `plugin.status`,
  `plugin.reload`, `plugin.disable`. Each registered under both the
  bare name and a `plugin_host.<method>` alias so both SOL and
  `.sflow` can call them.

### Orchestration

- **SOL** — a small Rust-like imperative DSL with one mesh primitive,
  `remote_call(peer, method, args)`. Typed `str` values, `let`, `if`,
  `while`, `for`, function definitions, `print`, `return`.
- **`.sflow`** — a line-oriented step-based DSL with `if`/`elif`/
  `else`, `loop N times`, `while`, `until`, `try`/`catch`/`rethrow`,
  `set var = ...`, `${var}` interpolation, and `sol.log` /
  `sol.sleep` / `sol.assert` / `sol.set_result` built-ins. The
  parser preserves the user's dotted target verbatim as
  `wire_method`, so plugin and multi-segment capabilities admit
  correctly.

### HTTP bridge

- OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` (including SSE
  streaming via `/chat/stream`) routed through the SOL chat flow.
- Operator dashboard at `/dashboard`: a single page with the task
  ledger plus collapsible mesh-topology and chronicle-retention
  dry-run widgets.
- Direct HTTP surfaces for every operator workflow listed above —
  see `docs/configuration.md` and the route list in
  `crates/relix-web-bridge/src/main.rs`.

### CLI

- `relix-cli` (installed as `relix`) with subcommands `identity`,
  `ping`, `task`, `capability`, `topology`, `ops`, `router`, `mcp`,
  `fs`, `web`, `browser`, `sol`, `doctor`, `terminal`, `flow-run`.
- New top-level wrappers: `relix boot`, `relix stop`, `relix status`
  — cross-platform mesh control over the underlying PowerShell /
  bash boot scripts.

### Tooling

- GitHub Actions CI (`fmt`, `clippy -D warnings`, `test --workspace`
  on Linux / macOS / Windows).
- Cross-platform install: `install.sh` (Mac / Linux) and
  `install.ps1` (Windows) that fetch pre-built release binaries.
- Mesh boot scripts: `scripts/relix-mesh-up.ps1` (Windows) and
  `scripts/relix-mesh-up.sh` (POSIX), with `relix-mesh-down.sh` for
  shutdown.
