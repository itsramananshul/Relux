# CI Strategy

Relix runs one required gate on every push and pull request, plus an
on-demand end-to-end lane and a nightly security pass. The required gate is
deliberately thorough so no regression can land green; the other two lanes
carry only the work that is too slow or too noisy to run on every push.

## Layer 1: `ci.yml` (required, every push / PR)

Runs unconditionally on every push to `main` and every pull request. This is
the gate that must be green before a change reaches `main`.

| Job          | Purpose                                                  | Runs on |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| `fmt`        | `cargo fmt --all -- --check`                             | ubuntu  |
| `build-test` | `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` then `cargo test --workspace` | ubuntu + macOS + windows |
| `deny`       | `cargo deny check` (licenses, bans, sources, advisories) | ubuntu  |

`build-test` runs the full ubuntu + macOS + windows matrix on purpose.
OS-gated code (`#[cfg(unix)]`, `#[cfg(target_os = "...")]`, path handling,
line endings) only compiles and lints on its own host, so a Linux-only run
would let an OS-specific regression land green. `fmt` and `deny` read
host-independent inputs (source text and the lockfile), so they run once on
Linux.

`build-test` uses a per-OS `Swatinem/rust-cache` shared key. The cache is
saved only on `main` (per the action's recommendation) to avoid pull-request
cache thrash, and cache failures are `continue-on-error` because the cache is
a speed optimisation, not a correctness gate.

## Layer 2: `heavy-ci.yml` (on-demand end-to-end)

The required hygiene gates now live in `ci.yml`, so `heavy-ci.yml` carries
only the heavy multi-process mesh bring-up, which is too slow and port-bound
to run on every push.

Triggers:

- `workflow_dispatch`: operator runs it before a milestone push.
- Pull request labeled `heavy`: runs the end-to-end demo against the PR.

| Job           | Purpose                                            |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `filter`      | gate the run on dispatch or the `heavy` label      |
| `integration` | `bash scripts/alpha-bringup-m5.sh` end-to-end demo |

This lane is not a required gate. It adds end-to-end coverage on request; it
does not duplicate the per-push hygiene checks.

## Layer 3: `nightly-security.yml` (scheduled + manual)

Triggers:

- Daily cron (`0 6 * * *` UTC).
- `workflow_dispatch`.

| Job           | Purpose                                                       |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `deny-strict` | `cargo deny check` (all categories incl. advisories) hard gate |
| `audit-strict`| `cargo audit` as a hard gate                                  |
| `full-tests`  | `cargo test --workspace --release`                            |

`issues: write` permission lets the lane open a tracking issue when a newly
published advisory breaks the strict pass. `ci.yml` already runs `cargo deny
check` on every PR, so most advisory drift is caught there first; nightly is
the backstop that catches advisories published after a change has merged.

## Per-advisory exceptions

If `audit-strict` or `deny-strict` flags an advisory that we have evaluated
and decided to accept (transitive, unreachable, or no fix available), the
exception is recorded in two coordinated places:

1. **`docs/security-advisories.md`**: human review notes, including the
   advisory ID, direct or transitive status, reachability assessment,
   severity in context, mitigation plan, and review condition.
2. **`deny.toml`** `[advisories] ignore = [...]`: machine-readable, with an
   inline comment naming the advisory ID and pointing at the docs entry.

No silent suppressions. Every entry has a removal condition (for example,
"remove after libp2p reaches 0.55").

## Local release gate: the first-release live smoke

`relix release readiness --run-local-gate` is the CLI front door for the local
release gate; under the hood it runs `scripts/ci-local.ps1`. That gate includes
one check that the GitHub matrix deliberately does **not**: the first-release
live boot smoke (`scripts/smoke-first-release.ps1`, with the POSIX peer
`scripts/smoke-first-release.sh`). It boots a real,
fully isolated mesh + web bridge as separate processes, authenticates the
dashboard session path over HTTP, hits the core dashboard APIs (with a
no-session negative control proving auth is enforced), and runs one real Brief
end-to-end on the safe local **echo** Rig — zero external model spend. In
`ci-local.ps1` it runs last, with `-SkipBuild` (reusing the binaries the
serial test gate just built) and `-RequireEchoFlow` (the echo product flow
becomes a hard failure), so a regression that breaks the first user-visible
loop fails the local release gate.

It is the **local** release gate on purpose, and is intentionally absent from
`ci.yml`. A live multi-process mesh bring-up — binding several ports, racing
process readiness, and exercising the full governed product path over HTTP —
is exactly the kind of slow, port-bound, timing-sensitive check this strategy
keeps off the per-push hosted-runner path (the same reason the `heavy-ci.yml`
end-to-end demo is dispatch/label only). Hosted runners give no reliability
benefit here and would add flake to a required gate. GitHub CI therefore stays
unit/build/dist only (clippy + `cargo test` per OS, dashboard-dist parity,
boot-policy parity, `cargo deny`); the live boot-and-use proof is the
operator's local release gate before tagging.

Run it directly any time:

- **Windows:** `.\scripts\smoke-first-release.ps1 -RequireEchoFlow`
- **POSIX:** `./scripts/smoke-first-release.sh --require-echo-flow`

To run the whole Windows-local gate from the product CLI:

```powershell
relix release readiness --run-local-gate
```

## Local-first workflow

The required gate mirrors the recommended local pre-push order:

```
cargo fmt --all
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
cargo deny check
```

Running these locally catches issues before they consume Actions minutes.
`relix release readiness --run-local-gate` runs the same set on a Windows dev
box, then finishes with the first-release live smoke described above as the
release gate.

## Windows build-parallelism cap (local gates)

On a memory-constrained Windows box, a from-scratch fully parallel build of the
heavy crates — `relux-kernel` (reqwest + rustls + axum) and the legacy relix
mesh (`relix-cli`/`-controller`/`relix-web-bridge`, which add libp2p) — launches
many codegen+link units at once and exhausts the system commit limit. `link.exe`
then dies with **LNK1102** (exit code 1102 / `0xc000012d` `STATUS_COMMIT_LIMIT`)
and rustc can throw an internal compiler error. The crashed units leave partial
artifacts in `target/`, which cascade into **bogus** follow-on errors on an
otherwise-green tree — "crate X required to be available in rlib format", "found
invalid metadata files for crate core/test", "can't find crate for
relix_runtime". These are not source defects; the same command succeeds from a
warm `target/` or with throttled parallelism.

The local PowerShell gates therefore cap peak build parallelism. `scripts/cargo-jobs.ps1`
exposes `Get-CargoJobsArgs`, which returns a `-j <N>` fragment (default **2**)
that the heavy cargo invocations splice in:

- `scripts/ci-local.ps1` — the `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets` gate
  (the serial `cargo test --workspace` gate is already capped harder via
  `CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=1`).
- `scripts/relux-first-release-check.ps1` — the core/kernel test, clippy, and
  release-build steps.
- `scripts/relux-package-local.ps1`, `scripts/relux-e2e-smoke.ps1`,
  `scripts/smoke-proposed-change-apply.ps1` — the `relux-kernel --release`
  builds.
- `scripts/smoke-first-release.ps1` — the relix-mesh `cargo build` (the heaviest
  cold link in the repo).

A warm/incremental build has too few units for the cap to bite, so tiny
package-specific targeted tests (e.g. `cargo test -p relux-core <filter>`) are
left uncapped. The cap is a Windows-local script convenience, **not** a global
`.cargo/config.toml` `[build] jobs` setting — a global config would silently
throttle every build for every user and platform. Override per-shell with
`$env:RELUX_CARGO_JOBS` (a higher integer for a bigger box, or `0` to disable the
cap and use cargo's default of all cores). GitHub Actions is unaffected; the
hosted runners have the headroom to build at full parallelism.

## Toolchain

`rust-toolchain.toml` pins **Rust 1.95** with `rustfmt` and `clippy`. The
required gate (`ci.yml`) installs that exact version via
`dtolnay/rust-toolchain@1.95.0` so fmt output and the clippy lint set are
reproducible; a floating `stable` pulls newer tools whose formatting and
lints drift from the pin and fail the gate for reasons unrelated to the
change under review. When the pin in `rust-toolchain.toml` moves, update the
workflow version in the same PR. `Swatinem/rust-cache@v2` provides layered
caching of the registry, git database, and target directory; cache keys are
per-OS to avoid cross-OS invalidation.

MSRV is documented in `README.md`.

## Discipline rules

- Keep `ci.yml` as the single required gate. Do not move a required check
  (fmt, clippy, test, deny) to a dispatch-only or label-only lane, because
  that lets the check be skipped on an ordinary PR.
- Keep the `build-test` matrix on all three operating systems. Dropping an OS
  reopens the gap where OS-gated regressions land green.
- Secret scanning belongs in an entropy-based scanner with an allowlist
  (gitleaks), tracked separately. A plain grep cannot work here because the
  redaction module and its docs legitimately contain key-shaped strings.
- Keep the heavy end-to-end demo off the per-push path. It is slow and
  port-bound; run it on dispatch or with the `heavy` label.
